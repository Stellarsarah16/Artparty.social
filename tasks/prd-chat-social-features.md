# Product Requirements Document: Chat & Social Features

## Introduction/Overview

The Stellar Collab App currently provides excellent collaborative pixel art creation through shared canvases and real-time tile editing. However, users lack the ability to communicate, provide feedback, and feel connected while working together. This PRD outlines the implementation of comprehensive chat and social features that will transform the app from a collaborative tool into an interactive community platform.

**Goal:** Create an integrated chat and social system that makes users feel like they're working together on a shared creative project, with immediate feedback capabilities, social connections, and community engagement.

## Goals

1. **Real-time Communication**: Enable instant messaging between users working on the same canvas
2. **Contextual Collaboration**: Allow users to comment on specific tiles, canvases, and provide targeted feedback
3. **Community Building**: Foster connections through user profiles, following systems, and activity feeds
4. **Enhanced Awareness**: Show who's working on what in real-time with rich presence indicators
5. **Canvas Engagement**: Enable social interactions with canvases (likes, comments, sharing)
6. **Mobile-First Design**: Ensure chat works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
7. **Non-Intrusive Integration**: Support collaborative work without disrupting the creative flow

## User Stories

### Core Communication
- **As a canvas collaborator**, I want to chat with other users currently viewing the same canvas so that we can coordinate our work
- **As a pixel artist**, I want to leave comments on specific tiles so that I can provide feedback or suggestions to other artists
- **As a canvas creator**, I want to receive comments on my canvas so that I can get feedback from the community
- **As a mobile user**, I want to access chat through a collapsible interface so that it doesn't block my view of the canvas

### Social Features  
- **As a user**, I want to create a profile with avatar and bio so that others can learn about me and my art style
- **As an art enthusiast**, I want to follow other users so that I can see their latest work and activity
- **As a community member**, I want to like and rate canvases so that I can show appreciation for great work
- **As a collaborator**, I want to see real-time activity feeds so that I know what others are working on

### Advanced Communication
- **As a canvas coordinator**, I want to use chat commands like "@user come help with tile 15,20" so that I can direct collaboration efficiently
- **As a user**, I want to send private messages to other users with canvas/tile context so that I can have focused discussions
- **As a community member**, I want to access a global message board for announcements and feature discussions

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Chat System Architecture

5.4. **Chat Toggle**: Button to show/hide chat interface on all screen sizes
5.5. **Adaptive Layout**: Chat interface adapts to screen size and orientation changes

### 6. Advanced Chat Features
6.1. **Chat Commands**: Support commands like `@username`, `@tile:15,20`, `@canvas:name`
6.2. **Message Threading**: Reply to specific messages to create threaded conversations
6.3. **Message Reactions**: React to messages with emoji reactions
6.4. **Message Search**: Search chat history by user, date, canvas, or content
6.5. **Message Notifications**: Visual and audio notifications for mentions and direct messages

### 7. Moderation & Safety
7.1. **User Reporting**: Report inappropriate messages or users
7.2. **Message Blocking**: Block messages from specific users
7.3. **Admin Controls**: Admins can delete messages, ban users, and moderate content
7.4. **Role-Based Permissions**: Different permission levels (admin, moderator, user)
7.5. **Content Filtering**: Basic profanity and spam filtering (future enhancement)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Video/Voice Chat**: Text-only communication for initial release
- **File Sharing**: No file uploads in chat (except canvas/tile references)

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Non-Intrusive**: Chat should enhance collaboration without blocking canvas work
- **Context-Aware**: Messages should clearly show canvas/tile context when relevant
- **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all device types and orientations
- **Consistent Styling**: Follow existing design system (CSS variables, component patterns)
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, proper contrast

### Component Integration
- **Manager Pattern**: Follow existing manager architecture with dedicated chat managers
- **Event System**: Use existing EventManager for cross-component communication
- **WebSocket Integration**: Extend existing WebSocket system for chat functionality
- **API Consistency**: Follow existing API patterns and error handling

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Requirements

### Performance Considerations
- **Message Pagination**: Load chat history in chunks to prevent performance issues
- **Connection Management**: Efficient WebSocket connection sharing between canvas and chat
- **Mobile Optimization**: Lightweight chat interface optimized for mobile performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache user profiles and frequently accessed data

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication Integration**: Use existing auth system for all chat features
- **Message Validation**: Server-side validation for all chat messages and commands

- **Database Performance**: Chat queries execute in <50ms average response time

## Open Questions

### Implementation Priority
1. Should we implement features in phases (Phase 1: Canvas chat, Phase 2: Social features, Phase 3: Advanced features)?
2. Which chat type should we prioritize first - canvas-specific rooms or direct messages?
3. Should user profiles be basic initially or include full statistics and galleries?

### Design Details
4. How prominent should the chat interface be - always visible or user-controlled visibility?
5. Should chat messages show user avatars, or just usernames to save space?
6. How should tile mentions be visually represented in chat (coordinates, thumbnails, highlights)?

### Technical Architecture
7. Should we create separate WebSocket channels for chat vs canvas updates, or multiplex over existing connections?
8. How should we handle chat message synchronization when users join/leave canvas rooms?
9. Should we implement optimistic UI updates for chat messages or wait for server confirmation?

### Future Considerations
10. How should this system scale if we have hundreds of users in a single canvas?
11. Should we consider chat message threading for complex collaborative discussions?
12. How will this integrate with future features like canvas versioning or branching?
