## üîÑ Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features (`feature/canvas-layers`)
- **bugfix/**: Bug fixes (`bugfix/tile-lock-issue`)
- **hotfix/**: Critical production fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request to `develop`

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

```python
# Use type hints
def create_tile(db: Session, tile_data: TileCreate) -> Tile:
    """Create a new tile with validation."""
    pass

# Follow PEP 8
class TileManager:
    """Manages tile operations."""
    
    def __init__(self, db_session: Session):
        self.db = db_session
```

### JavaScript (Frontend)

```javascript
// Use modern ES6+ features
class CanvasManager {
    /**
     * Initialize canvas manager
     * @param {HTMLCanvasElement} canvas - Canvas element
     */
    constructor(canvas) {
        this.canvas = canvas;
    }
    
    // Use descriptive method names
    async loadCanvasData(canvasId) {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// Use const/let, not var
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.stellarcollab.com';
```

### CSS

```css
/* Use CSS custom properties */
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
    --border-radius: 8px;
}

/* Use BEM methodology */
.canvas-editor {
    /* Block */
}

.canvas-editor__toolbar {
    /* Element */
}

.canvas-editor__toolbar--hidden {
    /* Modifier */
}
```

### General Guidelines

- **Comments**: Write clear, helpful comments
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions
- **Functions**: Keep functions small and focused
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive information
