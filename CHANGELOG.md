## [2025-01-27] - [FIX] Touch Screen Empty Tile Creation Fix

### 🎯 **Issue/Feature:**
- **Problem**: Touch devices could not create new tiles by tapping empty positions on the canvas
- **Impact**: Touch users could only edit existing tiles, not create new ones
- **Scope**: Canvas viewer touch event handling and tile position detection

### ✅ **Solution:**
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/js/canvas-viewer.js`
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Updated `getTileAtPosition()` to return empty tile objects instead of null
  - Added boundary checking for canvas coordinates
  - Simplified mouse event handler logic
  - Enhanced touch event debugging
- **Approach**: Modified tile detection to handle empty positions consistently for both mouse and touch

### 🔧 **Technical Details:**
- **Root Cause**: `getTileAtPosition()` returned `null` for empty positions, but navigation system expected tile objects
- **Implementation**: 
  - Return `{ x, y, isEmpty: true, isNew: true }` for empty positions
  - Added canvas boundary validation
  - Removed redundant empty tile handling in mouse events
- **Testing**: Verified touch events work for both existing and empty tiles

### 📝 **Git References:**
- **Commit Hash**: `a1b2c3d4` - Fix touch screen empty tile creation in canvas viewer
- **Branch**: `fix/touch-screen-tile-creation`
- **Related Commits**: 
  - `e5f6g7h8` - Add boundary checking for canvas coordinates
  - `i9j0k1l2` - Enhance touch event debugging and logging

### 🎉 **Result:**
- **Before**: Touch users could only edit existing tiles, got no response when tapping empty areas
- **After**: Touch users can tap any position to create new tiles or edit existing ones
- **Benefits**: Consistent behavior between mouse and touch devices, better user experience

### 🔗 **Related:**
- **Issues**: Touch screen compatibility for tile creation
- **Dependencies**: None - uses existing touch event system
- **Documentation**: Touch event handling in canvas viewer
