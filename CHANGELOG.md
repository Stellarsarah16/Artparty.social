## [2025-08-02] - [FEATURE] 8-Direction Neighbor Tile Display

### 🎯 **Issue/Feature:**
- **Problem**: Tile editor only showed the current tile without context of surrounding tiles, making it difficult to create seamless collaborative artwork
- **Impact**: Users couldn't see how their tile connected to neighbors, leading to disconnected designs and poor collaborative experience
- **Scope**: Enhanced tile editor to show all 8 surrounding tiles (4 cardinal + 4 diagonal) for complete visual context

### ✅ **Solution:**
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/index.html` - Added diagonal neighbor canvas elements (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)
  - `frontend/js/modules/managers/tile-editor-manager.js` - Implemented neighbor loading, detection, and rendering logic
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Extended 3x3 neighbor grid layout to include diagonal positions
  - Added `loadNeighborTiles()` method to fetch and display neighbor data
  - Implemented `findNeighborTiles()` with 8-direction detection logic
  - Created `displayNeighborTiles()` and `drawNeighborTile()` for rendering
  - Added automatic neighbor loading during tile editor initialization
- **Approach**: 
  - Fetched all canvas tiles and filtered for neighbors based on coordinate offsets
  - Rendered neighbor pixel data on dedicated canvases with proper scaling
  - Handled empty neighbor states gracefully with visual indicators

### 🔧 **Technical Details:**
- **Root Cause**: Original neighbor display only supported 4 cardinal directions, missing diagonal context
- **Implementation**: 
  - Used coordinate-based neighbor detection: `(x±1, y±1)` for all 8 directions
  - Implemented JSON parsing for neighbor pixel data to handle string format
  - Added 16px grid scaling for neighbor canvas rendering (512px/32 tiles)
  - Integrated with existing tile editor initialization flow
- **Testing**: 
  - Verified neighbor detection works for tiles at canvas edges (fewer neighbors)
  - Confirmed pixel data parsing handles both string and array formats
  - Tested empty neighbor state display and visual feedback

### 📝 **Git References:**
- **Commit Hash**: `N/A` - Changes made directly in development environment
- **Branch**: `main` (production deployment)
- **Related Commits**: Previous tile editor fixes and manager refactoring

### 🎉 **Result:**
- **Before**: Tile editor showed only current tile in isolation, no neighbor context
- **After**: Complete 8-direction neighbor view with pixel art display and empty state handling
- **Benefits**: 
  - Users can see how their tile connects to all surrounding tiles
  - Enables seamless collaborative artwork creation
  - Provides visual context for design continuity
  - Helps identify canvas boundaries and edge tiles
  - Improves overall collaborative pixel art experience

### 🔗 **Related:**
- **Issues**: Addresses user request for neighbor tile context in tile editor
- **Dependencies**: Requires existing tile API endpoints and pixel editor functionality
- **Documentation**: HTML structure supports responsive neighbor layout with CSS styling
