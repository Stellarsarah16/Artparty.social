# HTTPS Mixed Content Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing mixed content errors when trying to save tiles on the production server. The error occurred because the frontend was making HTTP requests to `http://artparty.social/api/v1/tiles/` while the page was loaded over HTTPS.

## Error Details
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://artparty.social/#editor' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://artparty.social/api/v1/tiles/'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

## Root Cause
The environment detection in `frontend/js/config.js` was not properly identifying the production environment, causing the API base URL to be constructed with HTTP instead of HTTPS. Additionally, the `frontend/js/modules/auth.js` file had a hardcoded fallback to `http://localhost:8000` that was being used in production.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Environment Detection
- Added specific checks for `artparty.social` domain
- Added comprehensive debugging logs
- Added fallback mechanisms for protocol detection

### 2. Force HTTPS for Production
- Added safety checks to ensure HTTPS is always used for production
- Implemented multiple layers of protection:
  - Environment detection level
  - Configuration level
  - API client level
  - Auth module level

### 3. Fixed Auth Module
- Fixed hardcoded HTTP URL in `frontend/js/modules/auth.js`
- Added secure base URL detection for auth module
- Added debugging to auth module fetch calls

### 4. Added Debugging
- Comprehensive logging throughout the configuration process
- URL construction debugging
- Environment detection debugging
- Auth module debugging

### 5. Enhanced Cache Busting
- Added version parameters to all JavaScript files
- Added timestamp-based cache busting
- Added cache prevention meta tags
- Created force reload utilities

## Files Modified

### `frontend/js/config.js`
- Enhanced `getBaseUrls()` function with better environment detection
- Added safety checks for HTTPS enforcement
- Added debugging logs
- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect for production

### `frontend/js/api.js`
- Added debugging to APIClient constructor
- Enhanced `buildURL()` method with final safety check
- Added comprehensive URL construction logging

### `frontend/js/modules/auth.js`
- Fixed hardcoded HTTP URL fallback
- Added secure base URL detection method
- Added debugging to all fetch calls
- Added HTTPS enforcement for production

### `frontend/index.html`
- Added cache-busting parameters to all JavaScript files
- Added cache prevention meta tags
- Added timestamp-based cache busting

### `frontend/test-https-fix.html`
- Created test page to verify the fix works
- Tests environment detection, URL construction, and API calls

### `frontend/clear-cache.html`
- Created cache clearing helper page
- Provides manual cache clearing instructions

### `frontend/force-reload.html`
- Created force reload utility
- Clears all browser storage and cache
- Forces reload of all JavaScript files

## Key Changes

### Environment Detection Enhancement
```javascript
// Production - Force HTTPS for security
if (hostname === 'artparty.social' || hostname.includes('artparty.social')) {
    console.log('üîß Using production URLs with forced HTTPS');
    return {
        API_BASE_URL: 'https://artparty.social',
        WS_BASE_URL: 'wss://artparty.social'
    };
}
```

### Safety Check for HTTPS
```javascript
// Safety check: Ensure HTTPS for production
const getSecureBaseURL = (baseURL) => {
    if (window.location.hostname === 'artparty.social' && baseURL.startsWith('http://')) {
        console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Forcing HTTPS for production security');
        return baseURL.replace('http://', 'https://');
    }
    return baseURL;
};
```

### Final API Client Safety Check
```javascript
// Final safety check: Force HTTPS for production
let secureURL = fullURL;
if (window.location.hostname === 'artparty.social' && fullURL.startsWith('http://')) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Final safety check: Converting HTTP to HTTPS');
    secureURL = fullURL.replace('http://', 'https://');
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Environment Detection Test
Visit `https://artparty.social/test-https-fix.html` and click "Test Environment Detection" to verify:
- Environment is correctly detected as production
- API base URL is using HTTPS
- All configuration values are correct

### 2. URL Construction Test
Click "Test URL Construction" to verify:
- All API URLs are constructed with HTTPS
- No HTTP URLs are generated for production

### 3. API Call Test
Click "Test API Call" to verify:
- API calls work correctly with HTTPS
- No mixed content errors occur

## Deployment

### 1. Update Files
Deploy the updated files to production:
- `frontend/js/config.js`
- `frontend/js/api.js`
- `frontend/index.html` (with cache-busting)
- `frontend/test-https-fix.html` (optional, for testing)
- `frontend/clear-cache.html` (optional, for cache clearing)

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
**CRITICAL**: Users must clear their browser cache to ensure the new configuration is loaded:

#### Option A: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
- **Windows**: Press `Ctrl+F5` or `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R`
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R`

#### Option B: Clear Cache via Developer Tools
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Storage
3. Click "Clear storage"
4. Reload the page

#### Option C: Use Clear Cache Page
Visit `https://artparty.social/clear-cache.html` and click "Clear Cache & Reload"

### 3. Verify Fix
- Test tile saving functionality
- Check browser console for HTTPS URLs
- Verify no mixed content errors
- Look for the message: `üîß HTTPS FIX VERSION 1.1.0 LOADED`

## Troubleshooting

### If Mixed Content Error Persists

#### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for these logs to verify the fix is loaded:
```
üîß HTTPS FIX VERSION 1.1.0 LOADED - Mixed content error should be resolved
üîß Current configuration: {API_BASE_URL: "https://artparty.social", ...}
```

#### 2. Force Cache Clear
If the logs show old configuration, force clear the cache:
- Close all browser tabs for the site
- Clear browser cache completely
- Restart the browser
- Visit the site again

#### 3. Check Network Tab
In Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab:
- Look for requests to `http://artparty.social` (should be none)
- All requests should be to `https://artparty.social`
- Check if JavaScript files are loading with cache-busting parameters

#### 4. Test Configuration
Visit `https://artparty.social/test-https-fix.html` and run the tests to verify:
- Environment detection is correct
- URL construction uses HTTPS
- API calls work properly

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Still seeing HTTP requests
**Solution**: Browser cache is holding old JavaScript files. Force clear cache and reload.

#### Issue: Configuration logs show old values
**Solution**: The new configuration files aren't loaded. Check cache-busting parameters in HTML.

#### Issue: Mixed content error on other pages
**Solution**: Check if other JavaScript files have hardcoded HTTP URLs.

## Cache-Busting Implementation

### Version Parameters
Added version parameters to critical JavaScript files:
```html
<script src="js/config.js?v=1.1.0"></script>
<script src="js/api.js?v=1.1.0"></script>
```

### Meta Tags
Added cache prevention meta tags:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
```

### Clear Cache Page
Created `frontend/clear-cache.html` to help users clear their cache and test configuration.
