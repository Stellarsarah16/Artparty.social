# HTTPS Mixed Content Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing mixed content errors when trying to save tiles on the production server. The error occurred because the frontend was making HTTP requests to `http://artparty.social/api/v1/tiles/` while the page was loaded over HTTPS.

## Error Details
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://artparty.social/#editor' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://artparty.social/api/v1/tiles/'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

## Root Cause
The environment detection in `frontend/js/config.js` was not properly identifying the production environment, causing the API base URL to be constructed with HTTP instead of HTTPS.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Environment Detection
- Added specific checks for `artparty.social` domain
- Added comprehensive debugging logs
- Added fallback mechanisms for protocol detection

### 2. Force HTTPS for Production
- Added safety checks to ensure HTTPS is always used for production
- Implemented multiple layers of protection:
  - Environment detection level
  - Configuration level
  - API client level

### 3. Added Debugging
- Comprehensive logging throughout the configuration process
- URL construction debugging
- Environment detection debugging

## Files Modified

### `frontend/js/config.js`
- Enhanced `getBaseUrls()` function with better environment detection
- Added safety checks for HTTPS enforcement
- Added debugging logs
- Added HTTP to HTTPS redirect for production

### `frontend/js/api.js`
- Added debugging to APIClient constructor
- Enhanced `buildURL()` method with final safety check
- Added comprehensive URL construction logging

### `frontend/test-https-fix.html`
- Created test page to verify the fix works
- Tests environment detection, URL construction, and API calls

## Key Changes

### Environment Detection Enhancement
```javascript
// Production - Force HTTPS for security
if (hostname === 'artparty.social' || hostname.includes('artparty.social')) {
    console.log('üîß Using production URLs with forced HTTPS');
    return {
        API_BASE_URL: 'https://artparty.social',
        WS_BASE_URL: 'wss://artparty.social'
    };
}
```

### Safety Check for HTTPS
```javascript
// Safety check: Ensure HTTPS for production
const getSecureBaseURL = (baseURL) => {
    if (window.location.hostname === 'artparty.social' && baseURL.startsWith('http://')) {
        console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Forcing HTTPS for production security');
        return baseURL.replace('http://', 'https://');
    }
    return baseURL;
};
```

### Final API Client Safety Check
```javascript
// Final safety check: Force HTTPS for production
let secureURL = fullURL;
if (window.location.hostname === 'artparty.social' && fullURL.startsWith('http://')) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Final safety check: Converting HTTP to HTTPS');
    secureURL = fullURL.replace('http://', 'https://');
}
```

## Testing

### 1. Environment Detection Test
Visit `https://artparty.social/test-https-fix.html` and click "Test Environment Detection" to verify:
- Environment is correctly detected as production
- API base URL is using HTTPS
- All configuration values are correct

### 2. URL Construction Test
Click "Test URL Construction" to verify:
- All API URLs are constructed with HTTPS
- No HTTP URLs are generated for production

### 3. API Call Test
Click "Test API Call" to verify:
- API calls work correctly with HTTPS
- No mixed content errors occur

## Deployment

### 1. Update Files
Deploy the updated files to production:
- `frontend/js/config.js`
- `frontend/js/api.js`
- `frontend/test-https-fix.html` (optional, for testing)

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
Users should clear their browser cache or do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to ensure the new configuration is loaded.

### 3. Verify Fix
- Test tile saving functionality
- Check browser console for HTTPS URLs
- Verify no mixed content errors

## Monitoring

### Console Logs to Watch For
- `üîß Environment Detection:` - Shows environment detection results
- `üîß Final Secure Configuration:` - Shows final API configuration
- `üîß APIClient initialized with:` - Shows API client configuration
- `üîß URL Construction:` - Shows URL construction process
- `üîß Final URL:` - Shows final constructed URL

### Warning Signs
- Any URLs starting with `http://` instead of `https://`
- Mixed content errors in browser console
- Failed API requests due to protocol mismatch

## Prevention

### 1. Environment Detection
Always test environment detection logic thoroughly before deployment.

### 2. Protocol Safety
Implement multiple layers of protocol safety checks.

### 3. Monitoring
Monitor console logs and network requests to catch similar issues early.

### 4. Testing
Use the test page to verify HTTPS configuration after any changes.
